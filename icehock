IMPORTANT CODES ARE THOSE OF THE IIHF AND THE NHL BOTH OF THE CODES AND 
OTHERS ORIGINATED FROM CANADIAN RULES OF ICE HOCKEY OF THE EARLY TH 
CENTURY ICE HOCKEY IS PLAYED ON A HOCKEY RINK DURING NORMAL PLAY THERE 
ARE SIX PLAYERS PER SIDE ON THE ICE AT ANY TIME ONE OF THEM BEING THE 
GOALTENDER EACH OF WHOM IS ON ICE SKATES THE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO 
SCORE GOALS BY SHOOTING A HARD VULCANIZED RUBBER DISC THE PUCK INTO THE 
OPPONENTS GOAL NET WHICH IS PLACED AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE RINK THE 
PLAYERS USE THEIR STICKS TO PASS OR SHOOT THE PUCK WITHIN CERTAIN 
RESTRICTIONS PLAYERS MAY REDIRECT THE PUCK WITH ANY PART OF THEIR BODY 
PLAYERS MAY NOT HOLD THE PUCK IN THEIR HAND AND ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING 
THEIR HANDS TO PASS THE PUCK TO THEIR TEAMMATES UNLESS THEY ARE IN THE 
DEFENSIVE ZONE PLAYERS ARE ALSO PROHIBITED FROM KICKING THE PUCK INTO THE 
OPPONENTS GOAL THOUGH INTENTIONAL REDIRECTIONS OFF THE SKATE ARE 
PERMITTED PLAYERS MAY NOT INTENTIONALLY BAT THE PUCK INTO THE NET WITH 
THEIR HANDS HOCKEY IS AN OFFSIDE GAME MEANING THAT FORWARD PASSES ARE 
ALLOWED UNLIKE IN RUGBY BEFORE THE S HOCKEY WAS AN ONSIDE GAME MEANING 
THAT ONLY BACKWARD PASSES WERE ALLOWED THOSE RULES FAVOURED INDIVIDUAL 
STICKHANDLING AS A KEY MEANS OF DRIVING THE PUCK FORWARD WITH THE ARRIVAL 
OF OFFSIDE RULES THE FORWARD PASS TRANSFORMED HOCKEY INTO A TRULY TEAM 
SPORT WHERE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE DIMINISHED IN IMPORTANCE RELATIVE TO 
TEAM PLAY WHICH COULD NOW BE COORDINATED OVER THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE 
ICE AS OPPOSED TO MERELY REARWARD PLAYERS BETWEEN THE SIX PLAYERS ON THE 
ICE THEY ARE TYPICALLY DIVIDED INTO THREE FORWARDS AND TWO DEFENSEMEN AND 
A GOALTENDER THE FORWARD POSITIONS CONSIST OF A CENTRE AND TWO WINGERS A 
LEFT WING AND A RIGHT WING FORWARDS OFTEN PLAY TOGETHER AS UNITS OR LINES 
WITH THE SAME THREE FORWARDS ALWAYS PLAYING TOGETHER THE DEFENCEMEN 
USUALLY STAY TOGETHER AS A PAIR GENERALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT 
LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE WINGERS OR DEFENCEMEN ARE GENERALLY POSITIONED AS 
SUCH BASED ON THE SIDE ON WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR STICK A SUBSTITUTION OF 
AN ENTIRE UNIT AT ONCE IS CALLED A LINE CHANGE TEAMS TYPICALLY EMPLOY 
ALTERNATE SETS OF FORWARD LINES AND DEFENSIVE PAIRINGS WHEN SHORTHANDED 
OR ON A POWER PLAY THE GOALTENDER STANDS IN A USUALLY BLUE SEMICIRCLE 
CALLED THE CREASE IN THE DEFENSIVE ZONE KEEPING PUCKS FROM GOING IN 
SUBSTITUTIONS ARE PERMITTED AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME ALTHOUGH DURING A 
STOPPAGE OF PLAY THE HOME TEAM IS PERMITTED THE FINAL CHANGE WHEN PLAYERS 
ARE SUBSTITUTED DURING PLAY IT IS CALLED CHANGING ON THE FLY A NEW NHL 
RULE ADDED IN THE SEASON PREVENTS A TEAM FROM CHANGING THEIR LINE AFTER 
THEY ICE THE PUCK THE BOARDS SURROUNDING THE ICE HELP KEEP THE PUCK IN 
PLAY AND THEY CAN ALSO BE USED AS TOOLS TO PLAY THE PUCK PLAYERS ARE 
PERMITTED TO BODYCHECK OPPONENTS INTO THE BOARDS AS A MEANS OF STOPPING 
PROGRESS THE REFEREES LINESMEN AND THE OUTSIDES OF THE GOAL ARE IN PLAY 
AND DO NOT CAUSE A STOPPAGE OF THE GAME WHEN THE PUCK OR PLAYERS ARE 
INFLUENCED BY EITHER BOUNCING OR COLLIDING INTO THEM PLAY CAN BE STOPPED 
IF THE GOAL IS KNOCKED OUT OF POSITION PLAY OFTEN PROCEEDS FOR MINUTES 
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WHEN PLAY IS STOPPED IT IS RESTARTED WITH A FACEOFF 
TWO PLAYERS FACE EACH OTHER AND AN OFFICIAL DROPS THE PUCK TO THE ICE 
WHERE THE TWO PLAYERS ATTEMPT TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE PUCK MARKINGS ON THE 
ICE INDICATE THE LOCATIONS FOR THE FACEOFF AND GUIDE THE POSITIONING OF 
PLAYERS THE THREE MAJOR RULES OF PLAY IN ICE HOCKEY THAT LIMIT THE 
MOVEMENT OF THE PUCK OFFSIDE ICING AND THE PUCK GOING OUT OF PLAY A 
PLAYER IS OFFSIDE IF HE ENTERS HIS OPPONENTS ZONE BEFORE THE PUCK ITSELF 
UNDER MANY SITUATIONS A PLAYER MAY NOT ICE THE PUCK SHOOT THE PUCK ALL 
THE WAY ACROSS BOTH THE CENTRE LINE AND THE OPPONENTS GOAL LINE THE PUCK 
GOES OUT OF PLAY WHENEVER IT GOES PAST THE PERIMETER OF THE ICE RINK ONTO 
THE PLAYER BENCHES OVER THE GLASS OR ONTO THE PROTECTIVE NETTING ABOVE 
THE GLASS AND A STOPPAGE OF PLAY IS CALLED BY THE OFFICIALS USING 
WHISTLES IT ALSO DOES NOT MATTER IF THE PUCK COMES BACK ONTO THE ICE 
SURFACE FROM THOSE AREAS AS THE PUCK IS CONSIDERED DEAD ONCE IT LEAVES 
THE PERIMETER OF THE RINK UNDER IIHF RULES EACH TEAM MAY CARRY A MAXIMUM 
OF PLAYERS AND TWO GOALTENDERS ON THEIR ROSTER NHL RULES RESTRICT THE 
TOTAL NUMBER OF PLAYERS PER GAME TO PLUS TWO GOALTENDERS IN THE NHL THE 
PLAYERS ARE USUALLY DIVIDED INTO FOUR LINES OF THREE FORWARDS AND INTO 
THREE PAIRS OF DEFENCEMAN ON OCCASION TEAMS MAY ELECT TO SUBSTITUTE AN 
EXTRA DEFENCEMAN FOR A FORWARD THIS SEVENTH DEFENCEMAN MIGHT SOMETIMES 
PLAY ON THE FOURTH LINE AS A FORWARDFURTHER EXPLANATION NEEDED PERIODS 
AND OVERTIMEEDIT A PROFESSIONAL GAME CONSISTS OF THREE PERIODS OF TWENTY 
MINUTES THE CLOCK RUNNING ONLY WHEN THE PUCK IS IN PLAY THE TEAMS CHANGE 
ENDS FOR THE SECOND PERIOD AGAIN FOR THE THIRD PERIOD AND AGAIN AT THE 
START OF EACH OVERTIME PLAYED RECREATIONAL LEAGUES AND CHILDRENS LEAGUES 
OFTEN PLAY SHORTER GAMES GENERALLY WITH THREE SHORTER PERIODS OF PLAY 
VARIOUS PROCEDURES ARE USED IF A GAME IS TIED IN TOURNAMENT PLAY AS WELL 
AS IN THE NHL PLAYOFFS NORTH AMERICANS FAVOUR SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME IN 
WHICH THE TEAMS CONTINUE TO PLAY TWENTYMINUTE PERIODS UNTIL A GOAL IS 
SCORED UP UNTIL THE SEASON REGULAR SEASON NHL GAMES WERE SETTLED WITH A 
SINGLE FIVEMINUTE SUDDEN DEATH PERIOD WITH FIVE PLAYERS PLUS A GOALIE PER 
SIDE WITH BOTH TEAMS AWARDED ONE POINT IN THE STANDINGS IN THE EVENT OF A 
TIE WITH A GOAL THE WINNING TEAM WOULD BE AWARDED TWO POINTS AND THE 
LOSING TEAM NONE JUST AS IF THEY HAD LOST IN REGULATION FROM UNTIL THE 
NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE DECIDED TIES BY PLAYING A SINGLE FIVEMINUTE SUDDEN 
DEATH OVERTIME PERIOD WITH EACH TEAM HAVING FOUR PLAYERS PLUS A GOALIE 
PER SIDE TO OPENUP THE GAME IN THE EVENT OF A TIE EACH TEAM WOULD STILL 
RECEIVE ONE POINT IN THE STANDINGS BUT IN THE EVENT OF A VICTORY THE 
WINNING TEAM WOULD BE AWARDED TWO POINTS IN THE STANDINGS AND THE LOSING 
TEAM ONE POINT THE IDEA WAS TO DISCOURAGE TEAMS FROM PLAYING FOR A TIE 
SINCE PREVIOUSLY SOME TEAMS MIGHT HAVE PREFERRED A TIE AND POINT TO 
RISKING A LOSS AND ZERO POINTS THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS IF A 
TEAM OPTS TO PULL THEIR GOALIE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN EXTRA SKATER DURING 
OVERTIME AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY SCORED UPON AN EMPTY NET GOAL IN WHICH CASE 
THE LOSING TEAM RECEIVES NO POINTS FOR THE OVERTIME LOSS STARTING IN THE 
SEASON THE SINGLE FIVEMINUTE SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME SESSION WILL CONSIST 
OF THREE PLAYERS PLUS A GOALIE INTERNATIONAL PLAY AND SEVERAL NORTH 
AMERICAN PROFESSIONAL LEAGUES INCLUDING THE NHL IN THE REGULAR SEASON NOW 
USE AN OVERTIME PERIOD IDENTICAL TO THAT FROM FOLLOWED BY A PENALTY 
SHOOTOUT IF THE SCORE REMAINS TIED AFTER AN EXTRA OVERTIME PERIOD THE 
SUBSEQUENT SHOOTOUT CONSISTS OF THREE PLAYERS FROM EACH TEAM TAKING 
PENALTY SHOTS AFTER THESE SIX TOTAL SHOTS THE TEAM WITH THE MOST GOALS IS 
AWARDED THE VICTORY IF THE SCORE IS STILL TIED THE SHOOTOUT THEN PROCEEDS 
TO A SUDDEN DEATH FORMAT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF GOALS SCORED DURING 
THE SHOOTOUT BY EITHER TEAM THE FINAL SCORE RECORDED WILL AWARD THE 
WINNING TEAM ONE MORE GOAL THAN THE SCORE AT THE END OF REGULATION TIME 
IN THE NHL IF A GAME IS DECIDED IN OVERTIME OR BY A SHOOTOUT THE WINNING 
TEAM IS AWARDED TWO POINTS IN THE STANDINGS AND THE LOSING TEAM IS 
AWARDED ONE POINT TIES NO LONGER OCCUR IN THE NHL THE OVERTIME MODE FOR 
THE NHL PLAYOFFS DIFFER FROM THE REGULAR SEASON IN THE PLAYOFFS THERE ARE 
NO SHOOTOUTS NOR TIES IF A GAME IS TIED AFTER REGULATION AN ADDITIONAL 
MINUTES OF ON SUDDEN DEATH OVERTIME WILL BE ADDED IN CASE OF A TIED GAME 
AFTER THE OVERTIME MULTIPLE MINUTE OVERTIMES WILL BE PLAYED UNTIL A TEAM 
SCORES WHICH WINS THEM THE MATCH IN ICE HOCKEY INFRACTIONS OF THE RULES 
LEAD TO PLAY STOPPAGES WHEREBY THE PLAY IS RESTARTED AT A FACE OFF SOME 
INFRACTIONS RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF A PENALTY TO A PLAYER OR TEAM IN 
THE SIMPLEST CASE THE OFFENDING PLAYER IS SENT TO THE PENALTY BOX AND 
THEIR TEAM HAS TO PLAY WITH ONE FEWER PLAYER ON THE ICE FOR A DESIGNATED 
AMOUNT OF TIME MINOR PENALTIES LAST FOR TWO MINUTES MAJOR PENALTIES LAST 
FOR FIVE MINUTES AND A DOUBLE MINOR PENALTY IS TWO CONSECUTIVE PENALTIES 
OF TWO MINUTES DURATION A SINGLE MINOR PENALTY MAY BE EXTENDED BY A 
FURTHER TWO MINUTES FOR CAUSING VISIBLE INJURY TO THE VICTIMIZED PLAYER 
THIS IS USUALLY WHEN BLOOD IS DRAWN DURING HIGH STICKING PLAYERS MAY BE 
ALSO ASSESSED PERSONAL EXTENDED PENALTIES OR GAME EXPULSIONS FOR 
MISCONDUCT IN ADDITION TO THE PENALTY OR PENALTIES THEIR TEAM MUST SERVE 
THE TEAM THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN A PENALTY IS SAID TO BE PLAYING SHORTHANDED

EMBELLISHES OR SIMULATES AN OFFENCE MORE EGREGIOUS FOULS MAY BE PENALIZED 
BY A FOURMINUTE DOUBLEMINOR PENALTY PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT INJURE THE 
VICTIMIZED PLAYER THESE PENALTIES END EITHER WHEN THE TIME RUNS OUT OR 
WHEN THE OTHER TEAM SCORES DURING THE POWER PLAY IN THE CASE OF A GOAL 
SCORED DURING THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF A DOUBLEMINOR THE PENALTY CLOCK IS 
SET DOWN TO TWO MINUTES UPON A SCORE EFFECTIVELY EXPIRING THE FIRST MINOR 
PENALTY FIVEMINUTE MAJOR PENALTIES ARE CALLED FOR ESPECIALLY VIOLENT 
INSTANCES OF MOST MINOR INFRACTIONS THAT RESULT IN INTENTIONAL INJURY TO 
AN OPPONENT OR WHEN A MINOR PENALTY RESULTS IN VISIBLE INJURY SUCH AS 
BLEEDING AS WELL AS FOR FIGHTING MAJOR PENALTIES ARE ALWAYS SERVED IN 
FULL THEY DO NOT TERMINATE ON A GOAL SCORED BY THE OTHER TEAM MAJOR 
PENALTIES ASSESSED FOR FIGHTING ARE TYPICALLY OFFSETTING MEANING NEITHER 
TEAM IS SHORTHANDED AND THE PLAYERS EXIT THE PENALTY BOX UPON A STOPPAGE 
OF PLAY FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PENALTIES THE FOUL 
OF BOARDING DEFINED AS CHECKING AN OPPONENT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT CAUSES 
THE OPPONENT TO BE THROWN VIOLENTLY IN THE BOARDS IS PENALIZED EITHER BY 
A MINOR OR MAJOR PENALTY AT THE DISCRETION OF THE REFEREE BASED ON THE 
VIOLENT STATE OF THE HIT A MINOR OR MAJOR PENALTY FOR BOARDING IS OFTEN 
ASSESSED WHEN A PLAYER CHECKS AN OPPONENT FROM BEHIND AND INTO THE BOARDS 
SOME VARIETIES OF PENALTIES DO NOT ALWAYS REQUIRE THE OFFENDING TEAM TO 
PLAY A MAN SHORT CONCURRENT FIVEMINUTE MAJOR PENALTIES IN THE NHL USUALLY 
RESULT FROM FIGHTING IN THE CASE OF TWO PLAYERS BEING ASSESSED FIVEMINUTE 
FIGHTING MAJORS BOTH THE PLAYERS SERVE FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT THEIR TEAM 
INCURRING A LOSS OF PLAYER BOTH TEAMS STILL HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF 
PLAYERS ON THE ICE THIS DIFFERS WITH TWO PLAYERS FROM OPPOSING SIDES 
GETTING MINOR PENALTIES AT THE SAME TIME OR AT ANY INTERSECTING MOMENT 
RESULTING FROM MORE COMMON INFRACTIONS IN THIS CASE BOTH TEAMS WILL HAVE 
ONLY FOUR SKATING PLAYERS NOT COUNTING THE GOALTENDER UNTIL ONE OR BOTH 
PENALTIES EXPIRE IF ONE PENALTY EXPIRES BEFORE THE OTHER THE OPPOSING 
TEAM GETS A POWER PLAY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TIME THIS APPLIES 
REGARDLESS OF CURRENT PENDING PENALTIES HOWEVER IN THE NHL A TEAM ALWAYS 
HAS AT LEAST THREE SKATERS ON THE ICE THUS TENMINUTE MISCONDUCT PENALTIES 
ARE SERVED IN FULL BY THE PENALIZED PLAYER BUT HIS TEAM MAY IMMEDIATELY 
SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER PLAYER ON THE ICE UNLESS A MINOR OR MAJOR PENALTY IS 
ASSESSED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MISCONDUCT A TWOANDTEN OR FIVEANDTEN IN 
THIS CASE THE TEAM DESIGNATES ANOTHER PLAYER TO SERVE THE MINOR OR MAJOR 
BOTH PLAYERS GO TO THE PENALTY BOX BUT ONLY THE DESIGNEE MAY NOT BE 
REPLACED AND HE IS RELEASED UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE TWO OR FIVE 
MINUTES AT WHICH POINT THE TENMINUTE MISCONDUCT BEGINS IN ADDITION GAME 
MISCONDUCTS ARE ASSESSED FOR DELIBERATE INTENT TO INFLICT SEVERE INJURY 
ON AN OPPONENT AT THE OFFICIALS DISCRETION OR FOR A MAJOR PENALTY FOR A 
STICK INFRACTION OR REPEATED MAJOR PENALTIES THE OFFENDING PLAYER IS 
EJECTED FROM THE GAME AND MUST IMMEDIATELY LEAVE THE PLAYING SURFACE HE 
DOES NOT SIT IN THE PENALTY BOX MEANWHILE IF AN ADDITIONAL MINOR OR MAJOR 
PENALTY IS ASSESSED A DESIGNATED PLAYER MUST SERVE OUT OF THAT SEGMENT OF 
THE PENALTY IN THE BOX SIMILAR TO THE ABOVEMENTIONED TWOANDTEN IN SOME 
RARE CASES A PLAYER MAY RECEIVE UP TO NINETEEN MINUTES IN PENALTIES FOR 
ONE STRING OF PLAYS THIS COULD INVOLVE RECEIVING A FOURMINUTE DOUBLE 
MINOR PENALTY GETTING IN A FIGHT WITH AN OPPOSING PLAYER WHO RETALIATES 
AND THEN RECEIVING A GAME MISCONDUCT AFTER THE FIGHT IN THIS CASE THE 
PLAYER IS EJECTED AND TWO TEAMMATES MUST SERVE THE DOUBLEMINOR AND MAJOR 
PENALTIES A PENALTY SHOT IS AWARDED TO A PLAYER WHEN THE ILLEGAL ACTIONS 
OF ANOTHER PLAYER STOP A CLEAR SCORING OPPORTUNITY MOST COMMONLY WHEN THE 
PLAYER IS ON A BREAKAWAY A PENALTY SHOT ALLOWS THE OBSTRUCTED PLAYER TO 
PICK UP THE PUCK ON THE CENTRE REDLINE AND ATTEMPT TO SCORE ON THE GOALIE 
WITH NO OTHER PLAYERS ON THE ICE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE EARLIER MISSED 
SCORING OPPORTUNITY A PENALTY SHOT IS ALSO AWARDED FOR A DEFENDER OTHER 
THAN THE GOALTENDER COVERING THE PUCK IN THE GOAL CREASE A GOALTENDER 
INTENTIONALLY DISPLACING HIS OWN GOAL POSTS DURING A BREAKAWAY TO AVOID A 
GOAL A DEFENDER INTENTIONALLY DISPLACING HIS OWN GOAL POSTS WHEN THERE IS 
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES TO PLAY IN REGULATION TIME OR AT ANY POINT DURING 
OVERTIME OR A PLAYER OR COACH INTENTIONALLY THROWING A STICK OR OTHER 
OBJECT AT THE PUCK OR THE PUCK CARRIER AND THE THROWING ACTION DISRUPTS A 
SHOT OR PASS PLAY AN ICE HOCKEY REFEREE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING MOST 
PENALTIES DURING A GAME OFFICIALS ALSO STOP PLAY FOR PUCK MOVEMENT 
VIOLATIONS SUCH AS USING ONES HANDS TO PASS THE PUCK IN THE OFFENSIVE END 
BUT NO PLAYERS ARE PENALIZED FOR THESE OFFENCES THE SOLE EXCEPTIONS ARE 
DELIBERATELY FALLING ON OR GATHERING THE PUCK TO THE BODY CARRYING THE 
PUCK IN THE HAND AND SHOOTING THE PUCK OUT OF PLAY IN ONES DEFENSIVE ZONE 
ALL PENALIZED TWO MINUTES FOR DELAY OF GAME IN THE NHL A UNIQUE PENALTY 
APPLIES TO THE GOALIES THE GOALIES NOW ARE FORBIDDEN TO PLAY THE PUCK IN 
THE CORNERS OF THE RINK NEAR THEIR OWN NET THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
TWOMINUTE PENALTY AGAINST THE GOALIES TEAM ONLY IN THE AREA INFRONT OF 
THE GOAL LINE AND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE NET MARKED BY TWO RED LINES ON 
EITHER SIDE OF THE NET THE GOALIE CAN PLAY THE PUCK AN ADDITIONAL RULE 
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN A PENALTY BUT WAS AN INFRACTION IN THE NHL BEFORE 
RECENT RULES CHANGES IS THE TWOLINE OFFSIDE PASS PRIOR TO THE NHL SEASON 
PLAY WAS STOPPED WHEN A PASS FROM INSIDE A TEAMS DEFENDING ZONE CROSSED 
THE CENTRE LINE WITH A FACEOFF HELD IN THE DEFENDING ZONE OF THE 
OFFENDING TEAM NOW THE CENTRE LINE IS NO LONGER USED IN THE NHL TO 
DETERMINE A TWOLINE PASS INFRACTION A CHANGE THAT THE IIHF HAD ADOPTED IN 
PLAYERS ARE NOW ABLE TO PASS TO TEAMMATES WHO ARE MORE THAN THE BLUE AND 
CENTRE ICE RED LINE AWAY THE NHL HAS TAKEN STEPS TO SPEED UP THE GAME OF 
HOCKEY AND CREATE A GAME OF FINESSE BY RETREATING FROM THE PAST WHERE 
ILLEGAL HITS FIGHTS AND CLUTCHING AND GRABBING AMONG PLAYERS WERE 
COMMONPLACE RULES ARE NOW MORE STRICTLY ENFORCED RESULTING IN MORE 
PENALTIES WHICH IN TURN PROVIDES MORE PROTECTION TO THE PLAYERS AND 
FACILITATES MORE GOALS BEING SCORED THE GOVERNING BODY FOR UNITED STATES 
AMATEUR HOCKEY HAS IMPLEMENTED MANY NEW RULES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF 
STICKONBODY OCCURRENCES AS WELL AS OTHER DETRIMENTAL AND ILLEGAL FACETS 
OF THE GAME ZERO TOLERANCE IN MENS HOCKEY BUT NOT IN WOMENS A PLAYER MAY 
USE HIS HIP OR SHOULDER TO HIT ANOTHER PLAYER IF THE PLAYER HAS THE PUCK 
OR IS THE LAST TO HAVE TOUCHED IT THIS USE OF THE HIP AND SHOULDER IS 
CALLED BODY CHECKING NOT ALL PHYSICAL CONTACT IS LEGAL IN PARTICULAR HITS 
FROM BEHIND HITS TO THE HEAD AND MOST TYPES OF FORCEFUL STICKONBODY 
CONTACT ARE ILLEGAL A DELAYED PENALTY CALL OCCURS WHEN A PENALTY OFFENSE 
IS COMMITTED BY THE TEAM THAT DOES NOT HAVE POSSESSION OF THE PUCK IN 
THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE TEAM WITH POSSESSION OF THE PUCK IS ALLOWED TO 
COMPLETE THE PLAY THAT IS PLAY CONTINUES UNTIL A GOAL IS SCORED A PLAYER 
ON THE OPPOSING TEAM GAINS CONTROL OF THE PUCK OR THE TEAM IN POSSESSION 
COMMITS AN INFRACTION OR PENALTY OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE THE TEAM ON WHICH 
THE PENALTY WAS CALLED CANNOT CONTROL THE PUCK WITHOUT STOPPING PLAY IT 
IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO SCORE A GOAL IN THESE CASES THE TEAM IN 
POSSESSION OF THE PUCK CAN PULL THE GOALIE FOR AN EXTRA ATTACKER WITHOUT 
FEAR OF BEING SCORED ON HOWEVER IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE CONTROLLING TEAM 
TO MISHANDLE THE PUCK INTO THEIR OWN NET IF A DELAYED PENALTY IS SIGNALED 
AND THE TEAM IN POSSESSION SCORES THE PENALTY IS STILL ASSESSED TO THE 
OFFENDING PLAYER BUT NOT SERVED IN THIS RULE WAS CHANGED BY THE NCAA FOR 
COLLEGE LEVEL HOCKEY IN THE UNITED STATES IN COLLEGE GAMES THE PENALTY IS 
STILL ENFORCED EVEN IF THE TEAM IN POSSESSION SCORES OFFICIALSEDIT MAIN 
ARTICLE OFFICIAL ICE HOCKEY A TYPICAL GAME OF HOCKEY IS GOVERNED BY TWO 
TO FOUR OFFICIALS ON THE ICE CHARGED WITH ENFORCING THE RULES OF THE GAME 
THERE ARE TYPICALLY TWO LINESMEN WHO ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CALLING 
OFFSIDE AND ICING VIOLATIONS BREAKING UP FIGHTS AND CONDUCTING FACEOFFS 
AND ONE OR TWO REFEREES WHO CALL GOALS AND ALL OTHER PENALTIES LINESMEN 
CAN HOWEVER REPORT TO THE REFEREES THAT A PENALTY SHOULD BE ASSESSED 
AGAINST AN OFFENDING PLAYER IN SOME SITUATIONS THE RESTRICTIONS ON THIS 
PRACTICE VARY DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNING RULES ONICE OFFICIALS ARE 
ASSISTED BY OFFICE OFFICIALS WHO ACT AS GOAL JUDGES TIME KEEPERS AND 
OFFICIAL SCORERS THE MOST WIDESPREAD SYSTEM IN USE TODAY IS THE THREEMAN 
SYSTEM THAT USES ONE REFEREE AND TWO LINESMEN ANOTHER LESS COMMONLY USED 
SYSTEM IS THE TWO REFEREE AND ONE LINESMAN SYSTEM THIS SYSTEM IS VERY 
CLOSE TO THE REGULAR THREEMAN SYSTEM EXCEPT FOR A FEW PROCEDURE CHANGES 
WITH THE FIRST BEING THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE A NUMBER OF LEAGUES HAVE 
STARTED TO IMPLEMENT THE FOUROFFICIAL SYSTEM WHERE AN ADDITIONAL REFEREE 
IS ADDED TO AID IN THE CALLING OF PENALTIES NORMALLY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS 
BY ONE SINGLE REFEREE THE SYSTEM IS NOW USED IN EVERY NHL GAME AT IIHF 
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS THE OLYMPICS AND IN MANY PROFESSIONAL AND HIGHLEVEL 
AMATEUR LEAGUES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE OFFICIALS ARE SELECTED BY THE 
LEAGUE THEY WORK FOR AMATEUR HOCKEY LEAGUES USE GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY 
NATIONAL ORGANIZING BODIES AS A BASIS FOR CHOOSING THEIR OFFICIATING 
STAFFS IN NORTH AMERICA THE NATIONAL ORGANIZING BODIES HOCKEY CANADA AND

SKATING DIRECTION IN ADDITION THEY MUST BE RIGID AND TOUGH TO PROTECT THE 
SKATERS FEET FROM CONTACT WITH OTHER SKATERS STICKS PUCKS THE BOARDS AND 
THE ICE ITSELF RIGIDITY ALSO IMPROVES THE OVERALL MANEUVERABILITY OF THE 
SKATE BLADE LENGTH THICKNESS WIDTH AND CURVATURE ROCKERRADIUS FRONT TO 
BACK AND RADIUS OF HOLLOW ACROSS THE BLADE WIDTH ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM 
SPEED OR FIGURE SKATES HOCKEY PLAYERS USUALLY ADJUST THESE PARAMETERS 
BASED ON THEIR SKILL LEVEL POSITION AND BODY TYPE MOST SKATES WIDTH ARE 
ABOUT AN OF AN INCH THICK THE ICE HOCKEY STICK CONSISTS OF A LONG 
RELATIVELY WIDE AND SLIGHTLY CURVED FLAT BLADE ATTACHED TO A SHAFT THE 
CURVE ITSELF HAS A BIG IMPACT ON ITS PERFORMANCE A DEEP CURVE ALLOWS FOR 
LIFTING THE PUCK EASIER WHILE A SHALLOW CURVE ALLOWS FOR EASIER BACKHAND 
SHOTS THE FLEX OF THE STICK ALSO IMPACTS THE PERFORMANCE TYPICALLY A LESS 
FLEXIBLE STICK IS MEANT FOR A STRONGER PLAYER SINCE THE PLAYER IS LOOKING 
FOR THE RIGHT BALANCED FLEX THAT ALLOWS THE STICK TO FLEX EASILY WHILE 
STILL HAVING A STRONG WHIPBACK WHICH SENDS THE PUCK FLYING AT HIGH SPEEDS 
IT IS QUITE DISTINCT FROM STICKS IN OTHER SPORTS GAMES AND MOST SUITED TO 
HITTING AND CONTROLLING THE FLAT PUCK ITS UNIQUE SHAPE CONTRIBUTED TO THE

A LOSS OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF BLOOD NOT ONLY ARE LACERATIONS COMMON IT IS 
ESTIMATED THAT DIRECT TRAUMA ACCOUNTS FOR OF ALL HOCKEY INJURIES MOST OF 
THESE INJURIES ARE CAUSED BY PLAYER CONTACT FALLS AND CONTACT WITH A PUCK 
HIGH STICK AND OCCASIONALLY A SKATE BLADECITATION NEEDED ONE OF THE 
CAUSES OF HEAD INJURY IS CHECKING FROM BEHIND DUE TO THE DANGER OF 
DELIVERING A CHECK FROM BEHIND MANY LEAGUES INCLUDING THE NHL HAVE MADE 
THIS A MAJOR AND GAME MISCONDUCT PENALTY CALLED BOARDING ANOTHER TYPE OF 
CHECK THAT ACCOUNTS FOR MANY OF THE PLAYERTOPLAYER CONTACT CONCUSSIONS IS 
A CHECK TO THE HEAD RESULTING IN A MISCONDUCT PENALTY CALLED HEAD CONTACT 
A CHECK TO THE HEAD CAN BE DEFINED AS DELIVERING A HIT WHILE THE 
RECEIVING PLAYERS HEAD IS DOWN AND THEIR WAIST IS BENT AND THE AGGRESSOR 
IS TARGETING THE OPPONENT PLAYERS HEAD THE MOST DANGEROUS RESULT OF A 
HEAD INJURY IN HOCKEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS A CONCUSSION MOST CONCUSSIONS 
OCCUR DURING PLAYERTOPLAYER CONTACT RATHER THAN WHEN A PLAYER IS CHECKED 
INTO THE BOARDS CHECKS TO THE HEAD HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY OF 
CONCUSSIONS THAT PLAYERS IN THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE HAVE SUFFERED 
CONCUSSIONS THAT PLAYERS SUFFER MAY GO UNREPORTED BECAUSE THERE IS NO 
OBVIOUS PHYSICAL SIGNS IF A PLAYER IS NOT KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS THIS CAN 
PROVE TO BE DANGEROUS IF A PLAYER DECIDES TO RETURN TO PLAY WITHOUT

PROGRESSIVELY BY GAINING LINES FIRST YOUR OWN BLUE LINE THEN THE RED LINE 
AND FINALLY THE OPPONENTS BLUE LINE NHL RULES INSTATED FOR THE SEASON 
REDEFINED THE OFFSIDE RULE TO MAKE THE TWOLINE PASS LEGAL A PLAYER MAY 
PASS THE PUCK FROM BEHIND HIS OWN BLUE LINE PAST BOTH THAT BLUE LINE AND 
THE CENTRE RED LINE TO A PLAYER ON THE NEAR SIDE OF THE OPPONENTS BLUE 
LINE OFFENSIVE TACTICS ARE DESIGNED ULTIMATELY TO SCORE A GOAL BY TAKING 
A SHOT WHEN A PLAYER PURPOSELY DIRECTS THE PUCK TOWARDS THE OPPONENTS 
GOAL HE OR SHE IS SAID TO SHOOT THE PUCK A DEFLECTION IS A SHOT THAT 
REDIRECTS A SHOT OR A PASS TOWARDS THE GOAL FROM ANOTHER PLAYER BY

THE ICE LOAFING ALSO KNOWN AS CHERRYPICKING IS WHEN A PLAYER USUALLY A 
FORWARD SKATES BEHIND AN ATTACKING TEAM INSTEAD OF PLAYING DEFENSE IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO CREATE AN EASY SCORING CHANCE A TEAM THAT IS LOSING BY ONE OR 
TWO GOALS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF PLAY WILL OFTEN ELECT TO PULL THE 
GOALIE THAT IS REMOVE THE GOALTENDER AND REPLACE HIM OR HER WITH AN EXTRA 
ATTACKER ON THE ICE IN THE HOPE OF GAINING ENOUGH ADVANTAGE TO SCORE A 
GOAL HOWEVER IT IS AN ACT OF DESPERATION AS IT SOMETIMES LEADS TO THE 
OPPOSING TEAM EXTENDING THEIR LEAD BY SCORING A GOAL IN THE EMPTY NET ONE 
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIES FOR A TEAM IS THEIR FORECHECK 
FORECHECKING IS THE ACT OF ATTACKING THE OPPOSITION IN THEIR DEFENSIVE 
ZONE FORECHECKING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE DUMP AND CHASE STRATEGY IE 
SHOOTING THE PUCK INTO THE OFFENSIVE ZONE AND THEN CHASING AFTER IT EACH 
TEAM WILL USE THEIR OWN UNIQUE SYSTEM BUT THE MAIN ONES ARE AND THE IS 
THE MOST BASIC FORECHECK SYSTEM WHERE TWO FORWARDS WILL GO IN DEEP AND 
PRESSURE THE OPPOSITIONS DEFENCEMEN THE THIRD FORWARD STAYS HIGH AND THE 
TWO DEFENCEMEN STAY AT THE BLUELINE THE IS A BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE SYSTEM 
WHERE ONE FORWARD PRESSURES THE PUCK CARRIER AND THE OTHER TWO FORWARDS 
COVER THE OPPOSITIONS WINGERS WITH THE TWO DEFENCEMEN STAYING AT THE 
BLUELINE THE IS THE MOST DEFENSIVE FORECHECK SYSTEM REFERRED TO AS THE 
NEUTRAL ZONE TRAP WHERE ONE FORWARD WILL APPLY PRESSURE TO THE PUCK 
CARRIER AROUND THE OPPOSITIONS BLUELINE AND THE OTHER PLAYERS STAND 
BASICALLY IN A LINE BY THEIR BLUELINE IN HOPES THE OPPOSITION WILL SKATE 
INTO ONE OF THEM ANOTHER STRATEGY IS THE LEFT WING LOCK WHICH HAS TWO 
FORWARDS PRESSURE THE PUCK AND THE LEFT WING AND THE TWO DEFENCEMEN STAY 
AT THE BLUELINE THERE ARE MANY OTHER LITTLE TACTICS USED IN THE GAME OF 
HOCKEY CYCLING MOVES THE PUCK ALONG THE BOARDS IN THE OFFENSIVE ZONE TO 
CREATE A SCORING CHANCE BY MAKING DEFENDERS TIRED OR MOVING THEM OUT OF 
POSITION PINCHING IS WHEN A DEFENCEMEN PRESSURES THE OPPOSITIONS WINGER 
IN THE OFFENSIVE ZONE WHEN THEY ARE BREAKING OUT ATTEMPTING TO STOP THEIR 
ATTACK AND KEEP THE PUCK IN THE OFFENSIVE ZONE A SAUCER PASS IS A PASS 
USED WHEN AN OPPOSITIONS STICK OR BODY IS IN THE PASSING LANE IT IS THE 
ACT OF RAISING THE PUCK OVER THE OBSTRUCTION AND HAVING IT LAND ON A 
TEAMMATES STICK A DEKE SHORT FOR DECOY IS A FEINT WITH THE BODY OR STICK
